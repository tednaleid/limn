- hamburger menu additions
    - about dialog
    - keyboard shortcuts overlay
    - find/cmd-f?

- add LICENSE

- talk through url schema, right now we're not doing anything with the url there are a few issues that I want to talk through
    - possibility of encoding document in the url so it could be sent to someone else
        - where does this fall down, what are the length limitations for it? would probably preclude images
    - giving each document its own unique ID that's in the url, when we're using local storage is having them listed an option? are we storing them separately from each other now?

- turn into obsidian plugin, similar to excalidraw, this is likely the place where I'll use this the most
    - investigate what needs to be separated out from the browser version we have now, storage concerns for json/images, etc
